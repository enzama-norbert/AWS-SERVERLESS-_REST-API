# AWS-SERVERLESS-REST-API

This project implements a fully serverless REST API on AWS to manage a simple to-do list (or customer records). It uses **Amazon API Gateway**, **AWS Lambda**, and **Amazon DynamoDB** for the backend, with a static **frontend hosted on S3**. The API supports full CRUD operations.
